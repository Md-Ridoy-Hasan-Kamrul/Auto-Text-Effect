## Features

- **Typewriter Animation**: Text appears character by character, creating a realistic typing effect
- **Speed Control**: Adjustable speed slider (1-10) to control animation timing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Real-time Updates**: Speed changes take effect immediately

## How It Works

The project uses JavaScript to:

1. Display text character by character using `slice()`
2. Loop the animation when it reaches the end
3. Allow users to control speed via an input slider
4. Update animation timing in real-time

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Watch the text "We Love Programming!" appear with a typewriter effect
3. Use the speed slider to adjust animation speed (1 = slowest, 10 = fastest)
4. The animation will continuously loop
